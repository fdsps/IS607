Dataset used:

https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Airfoil+Self-Noise#

```{r}
mydata <- read.table("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fdsps/IS607/master/airfoil_self_noise.txt")
names(mydata) <- c("freq","angle","chordlen","FSVel","SSDT","SSPLdB")
head(mydata)
summary(mydata)
```

Let's subset it

```{r}
ss <- subset(mydata, freq < 2000)
head(ss)
summary(ss)
```

Hmm, that's about it.
